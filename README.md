## binary search
Implementing the binary search algorithm that allows searching very efficiently (even huge) lists, provided that the list is sorted.

## binary search with Duplicates
Find the first occurence of an integer in the given sorted sequence of integers (possibly with duplicates)

## car fueling
You are going to travel to another city that is located 𝑑 miles away from your home city. Your car can travel
at most 𝑚 miles on a full tank and you start with a full tank. Along your way, there are gas stations at
distances stop1, stop2, . . . , stop𝑛 from your home city. What is the minimum number of refills needed?

## majority Element
Majority rule is a decision rule that selects the alternative which has a majority, that is, more than half the votes.
Given a sequence of elements 𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, you would like to check whether
it contains an element that appears more than 𝑛/2 times. O(nlogn) using Divide and conquer.

## Maximum Pairwise Product
Find the maximum product of two distinct numbers in a sequence of non-negative integers.
