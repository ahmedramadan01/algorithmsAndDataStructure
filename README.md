This Algorithms are based on SanDiego Datastructures and Algorithms specialization on coursera

## binary search
Implementing the binary search algorithm that allows searching very efficiently (even huge) lists, provided that the list is sorted.

## binary search with Duplicates
Find the first occurence of an integer in the given sorted sequence of integers (possibly with duplicates)

## car fueling
You are going to travel to another city that is located 洧녬 miles away from your home city. Your car can travel
at most 洧녴 miles on a full tank and you start with a full tank. Along your way, there are gas stations at
distances stop1, stop2, . . . , stop洧녵 from your home city. What is the minimum number of refills needed?

## majority Element
Majority rule is a decision rule that selects the alternative which has a majority, that is, more than half the votes.
Given a sequence of elements 洧녩1, 洧녩2, . . . , 洧녩洧녵, you would like to check whether
it contains an element that appears more than 洧녵/2 times. O(nlogn) using Divide and conquer.

## Maximum Pairwise Product
Find the maximum product of two distinct numbers in a sequence of non-negative integers.

## change money using Dynamic programming
Find the minimum coins to change a given money.and you can choose also denominations.

## edit_distance using Dynamic Programming
The edit distance between two strings is the minimum number of operations (insertions, deletions, and
substitutions of symbols) to transform one string into another.It is a measure of similarity of two strings.
Edit distance has applications, for example, in computational biology, natural language processing, and spell
checking. Your goal in this problem is to compute the edit distance between two strings.

## primitive calculator using dp
You are given a primitive calculator that can perform the following three operations with
the current number 洧논: multiply 洧논 by 2, multiply 洧논 by 3, or add 1 to 洧논. Your goal is given a
positive integer 洧녵, find the minimum number of operations needed to obtain the number 洧녵
starting from the number 1.
